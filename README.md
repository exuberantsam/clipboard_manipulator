# clipboard_manipulator
Simple program that utilizes regular expression to match the text saved in the clipboard and then replace with another string if it matches the regex.  In my case, I created a regular expression that matches bitcoin addresses (both v.1 and v.2) and whenever it matches what's in the clipboard, it will replace another bitcoin address which is mine.  THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY AND NO HARM INTENDED.
