Clipboard Manipulator

Simple program that utilizes System.Windows.Forms.Timer and System.Text.RegularExpression to monitor the clipboard and match the text saved in the clipboard and then replace with another string if it matches the regex pattern.

In my case, I created a regular expression that matches bitcoin addresses (both v.1 and v.2) and whenever it matches what's in the clipboard, it will replace another bitcoin address which is mine.

You can replace the string pattern with your own, it can be plain text or regular expression.
